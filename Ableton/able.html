           <p>
            Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of 
            us use Live and Push every day. We come from a wide range of cultural
             and professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are self-taught, 
             and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects us is the shared 
             belief that each of us has the skills and knowledge to contribute 
            to something big: helping to shape the future of music culture.

            always agree with each other, but opinion and debate are valued and openly encouraged.

            Alongside an internal training program, employees are actively supported in acquiring new 
            knowledge and skills, and coached on applying these in their daily work. In addition, staff-organized 
            development and music salons are a chance to discuss new technologies, production 
            techniques and best practices.
